    <h1>Privacy Policy — CodeCamp</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>September 6, 2025</strong></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>CodeCamp</strong> (the "App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our mobile application and related services. By using CodeCamp you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account & Profile:</strong> name, email address, profile picture, college/branch, year of study (if you create an account).</li>
      <li><strong>Resume & Career Data:</strong> resume/CV details you enter or upload for resume-building features.</li>
      <li><strong>Quizzes & Progress:</strong> answers, scores, course completion data, bookmarks and notes.</li>
      <li><strong>Support & Feedback:</strong> messages you submit through contact or feedback forms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> device model, operating system, app version, log files, crash reports, timestamps, and pages/screens visited.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> anonymized analytics about how you use the app (e.g., feature usage, time spent, interactions).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Third-Party & Integrated Services</h3>
    <p>When you choose to use third-party integrations (for example, Google Sign-In, payment providers, cloud storage, or analytics services), we may receive information from those providers as permitted by their APIs and your settings.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the App's features (learning content, quizzes, resume builder, calculator, AI assistance).</li>
      <li>To personalize your experience — recommend courses, track progress, restore your data across devices.</li>
      <li>To communicate with you about updates, offers, and important notices.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage and improve the app's performance, features, and content.</li>
      <li>To detect, prevent and respond to fraud, abuse, technical issues, or security incidents.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. AI Features & Generated Content</h2>
    <p>If you use AI-powered tools (chat assistant, automated suggestions, code/help generation), we may process the input you provide to generate responses. You should avoid sharing sensitive personal data in free-text prompts. AI inputs and outputs may be logged for quality improvement and debugging unless you disable this in-app (if such an option is provided).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with vendors who perform services (analytics, cloud hosting, email delivery, payment processing) under contracts that require them to protect your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information to comply with legal obligations, enforce our Terms of Service, or protect our rights, property, or safety.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Third-Party Links & SDKs</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party sites, services, or integrate SDKs (analytics, ads, cloud). These third parties have their own privacy policies and practices. We recommend reviewing their privacy statements before providing personal information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to store preferences, session tokens, and small amounts of user data on your device. You can clear app data or uninstall the app to remove locally stored data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect user information. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. When information is no longer required, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessing a copy of your data</li>
      <li>Correcting inaccurate data</li>
      <li>Requesting deletion of your data</li>
      <li>Objecting to or restricting processing</li>
      <li>Data portability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below. We may need to verify your identity before responding to requests.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data collected may be stored and processed in the servers of our service providers located in different countries. By using the App, you consent to such transfers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>12. Payments & Purchases</h2>
    <p>If you make in-app purchases, payment processing is handled by the platform (Google Play / App Store) or third-party payment providers. We do not directly collect most payment card details. Transaction receipts and related data are retained for record-keeping and support.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will highlight the change within the app or via email. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
